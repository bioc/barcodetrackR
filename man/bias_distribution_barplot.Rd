\usage{
bias_distribution_barplot(
  your_SE,
  split_bias_on,
  bias_1,
  bias_2,
  split_bias_over,
  bias_over = NULL,
  breaks = c(10, 5, 2, 1, 0),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{your_SE}{A summarized experiment object.}

\item{split_bias_on}{The column in `colData(your_SE)` from which `bias_1` and `bias_2` will be chosen}

\item{bias_1}{The factor you wish to plot on the left side of the plots.}

\item{bias_2}{The factor you wish to plot on the right side of the plots.}

\item{split_bias_over}{The column in `colData(your_SE)` that you wish to observe the bias split on. Defaults to all.}

\item{bias_over}{Choice(s) from the column designated in `split_bias_over` that will be used for plotting.}

\item{breaks}{The breaks specified for bins on the x-axis (how biased the clones are towards one factor or the other).}
}
\description{
Plots each clone as a stacked bar, binned according to how biased it is towards one factor or the other..
