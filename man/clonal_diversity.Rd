\item{plot_over_display_choices}{Choice(s) from the column designated in plot_over that will be used for plotting. Defaults to all if left as NULL.}

\item{group_by}{The column of metadata you want to group by e.g. cell_type}

\item{index_type}{Character. One of "count", "shannon", "shannon_count", "simpson", or "invsimpson.}
