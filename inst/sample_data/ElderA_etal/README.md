For using the Elder et al sample data in the create_SE function or the barcodetrackR app, use the counts data file "L4951_count_matrix.txt" and the metadata file "L4951_metadata.txt". <br /> The publicly available raw data from the published manuscript is available through NIH GEO using the accession number GSE149170. The script preprocessing.R reads in the raw data from GEO and outputs one of the experiments' counts and metadata files in the format amenable to barcodetrackR.
